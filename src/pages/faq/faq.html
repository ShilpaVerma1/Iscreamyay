  <p class="first-para"><span>Q. </span>Are the estimates on the app very reliable? </p>
    <p class="second-para">While all our events are pretty much confirmed before we add it to the map, we cannot guarantee a particular quantity of ice creams you will sell or how much you will make. We provide you with the estimates so you can make a better Business intelligence decision. Always consider real life circumstances that might affect your sales like other drivers getting there before you, road constructions that might delay the event. </p>
