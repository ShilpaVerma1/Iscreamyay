      Many ice cream drivers start their own business or franchise.
      This means you need to buy an ice cream truck equipped with speakers and freezers, decorate your truck, establish a route, inquire about permits and licenses, and pick your ice cream niche.
      You might buy ice cream from companies like Klondike, Good Humor, Nestle, Popsicle or Breyers.
      The real question is will you sell soft serve, novelties, or shaved ice?

    <p >As you establish your route, you’ll realize the hot spots where kids are schools, parks, ballgames, neighbourhoods. Kids and their parents are your main market. Your success will be directly associated with where you choose to sell your treats. There are lots of ice cream truck vendors that want to sell ice cream and only so many ice cream buying kids. Be sure to respect other ice cream truck driver’s stomping ground.

    <p>Ice cream truck drivers are almost always paid on commission. The average earning is about $400 to $700 per week all summer. If it’s rainy and nasty out, you may not make much money, but if the sun is blazing and it’s the Fourth of July you may pull in big bucks.
    </p>
    <p >Ice cream truck drivers serve up ice cream cookies, rocket pops, swirl popsicles, chocolate, vanilla, and lemon lime to kids across the entire country. Every summer ice cream truck drivers are needed. When you’re cruising down the block, playing your familiar jingle, and kids are rushing to you with smiles across their faces, counting their pennies, you’ll know you have a pretty cool summer job.
